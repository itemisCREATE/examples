# Welcome to the itemis CREATE (formerly YAKINDU Statechart Tools) Examples Repository!

This repository is hosting examples for [**itemis CREATE**](https://www.itemis.com/en/products/itemis-create/).

With YAKINDU Statechart Tools, you can easily create complex systems in a visual way. Simulate and test your systemâ€™s behavior already while you are modeling. Code generators translate your state machine into high-quality source code for different target platforms.

For each major release a separate branch is maintained for the released examples. These branches are:

- [release5](https://github.com/itemisCREATE/examples/tree/release5?tab=readme-ov-file) - the current release
- [release4](https://github.com/itemisCREATE/examples/tree/release3?tab=readme-ov-file)
- [release](https://github.com/itemisCREATE/examples/tree/release3?tab=readme-ov-file) - for pre v4 examples 

You can browse [all examples on our website.](https://www.itemis.com/en/yakindu/statechart-tools/documentation/examples/)

Using the **Example Wizard**, which is available in [YAKINDU Statechart Tools since release 2.7](https://www.itemis.com/en/yakindu/statechart-tools/), clones this repository to your local disk and so that you can explore the examples easily.
