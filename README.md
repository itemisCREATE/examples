# Welcome to the Itemis CREATE Examples Repository!

This repository is hosting examples for [**Itemis CREATE**](https://www.itemis.com/en/yakindu/state-machine/).

With Itemis CREATE, you can easily create complex systems in a visual way. Simulate and test your systemâ€™s behavior already while you are modeling. Code generators translate your state machine into high-quality source code for different target platforms.
