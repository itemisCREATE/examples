    <h1>Swift Example</h1>

    <p>Demonstrates how to to generate Swift source code from a statechart.</p>

    <p>
      <img class="standard-image" alt="The statechart"
        src="images/swift_example_statechart.png" />
    </p>

    <p>
      The application consists of one screen that iterates between three different buttons each second. 
      Clicking on one of the buttons results in a change of direction. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The example is based on Swift and contains a small GUI that demonstrate the state machine behaviour in model/SwiftExample.sct. 
        This example combines generated Swift code with manual Swift implementations (the GUI). 
        To generate the state machine code, right-click on model/SwiftExample.sgen and select 'Generate Code Artifacts'. 
        To start the application execute 'swift build' in the Folder containing the Example Code. 
        Afterwards the program can be started with './.build/debug/SwiftExample'.
