  <h1>Basic Finite State Machine for Arduino</h1>

  <p>A very basic example for the Arduino platform that switches an LED on
    and off.</p>

  <p>
    This example was used in an article on the website <a
      href="http://www.instructables.com/">instructables.com</a>. You can read
    the article <a
      href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Finite-State-Machine-on-an-Arduino/">here</a>.
    It demonstrates how to get started with YAKINDU Statechart Tools and the
    Arduino platform and contains a timer service for the Arduino. You need to
    have an Arduino plugin, as described in the example "Arduino traffic light".
