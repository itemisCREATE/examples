<h1>CREATE Labs Projects</h1>

<p>Researching, prototyping, and putting our ideas into code, aside from the day-to-day business, is an essential part of itemis' company culture. 
CREATE Labs is a collection of projects that are currently in beta phase and therefore not yet released with any CREATE product bundles. 
As we love early feedback, we regularly blog about what's going on behind the scenes. So try it, and get in touch with us! </p>

<p>This repository hosts the following Itemis CREATE features:
<ul>
	<li>TypeScript code generator</li>
	<li>Python code generator</li>
	<li>Swift code generator</li>
	</ul>
</p>
