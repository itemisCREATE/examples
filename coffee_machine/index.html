    <h1>Four Iterations Of A Coffee Machine</h1>
	<p>This example introduces composite states with three consecutive statecharts.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>The first statechart is the base for all other statecharts. It models a very basic automated coffee machine. The statechart does not contain any features but states and transitions.
			The user can switch the machine on and off, and order a cappuchino when the machine is turned on. He can also cancel the operation anytime.

			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p> The second statechart introduces the composite state, which allows to cut all but one "User.cancel" transitions.

			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>The third iteration shows how to use many composite states to introduce additional behavior without adding too much clutter to the statechart.
