      <h2>Integration in GNU Make</h2>
      <p>
        With Makefiles, you are able to define your compile targets and its
        dependencies. Every time a dependency is changed, the next run of <a
          href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">Make</a> will recompile said
        target. Using this infrastructure it is pretty simple to generate code
        from statecharts whenever needed.<br>
      <p>
        <br>The build of this project can be viewed as a dependency tree.
        To build the executable, we would need to link the object files main.o
        and defaultSM.o. To create these, we need to compile main.c and
        defaultSM.c. To have defaultSM.c we need to generate the statechart from
        defaultSM.sct and defaultSM.sgen – that’s it.<br>
        <br>The makefile looks like this:
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">.PHONY: all<br>.PHONY: clean<br><br>all: main<br><br>main: src-gen/DefaultSM.o main.o<br>    gcc -o main src-gen/DefaultSM.o main.o<br><br>clean:<br>    rm -rf src src-gen *.o main<br><br>main.o: main.c<br>    gcc -Wall -c main.c<br><br>src-gen/DefaultSM.o: src-gen/DefaultSM.c<br>    gcc -Wall -c src-gen/DefaultSM.c -o src-gen/DefaultSM.o<br><br>src-gen/DefaultSM.c: defaultSM.sct defaultSM.sgen<br>    scc</pre>
      <p>
        <br> It’s a good practice to name the default target ‘all’, but you
        could remove it.<br>
        <br>The line main: src-gen/DefaultSM.o main.o states that the file
        main (the final executable, no file ending is needed on Linux) depends
        on both these object files. The order is important here, because
        otherwise the compiler would fail, stating that the header files also
        generated from the statechart are not available when compiling main.c –
        you could work around this but this is an easy solution.<br>
        <br>Both these dependencies are reinterpreted as targets, which
        have other dependencies. This is standard make stuff. The most
        interesting entry is this:
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">src-gen/DefaultSM.c: defaultSM.sct defaultSM.sgen<br>    scc</pre>
      <p>
        <br> This says “to produce src-gen/DefaultSM.c, which depends on
        defaultSM.sct and defaultSM.sgen, call ‘scc’". Calling scc without
        arguments is possible here, because the Makefile is located in the
        project and scc will just generate everything in there.<br>
        <br>Adding both the *.sct and the *.sgen file has the additional
        benefit that a change in either of them results in a re-generation of
        the statechart sources – for example when you change the options in the
        *.sgen file.<br>
        <br>The clean target removes all object files and the folders src
        and src-gen, both generated by YAKINDU Statechart Tools. Pay attention
        when you have sources in ‘src’ as well.<br>
