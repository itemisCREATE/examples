    <h1>Custom Generator Example for SCXML</h1>

    <p>
      This example explains how to develop a custom code generator for the open
      source framework <a href="http://www.statecharts.org" target="_blank">YAKINDU
        Statechart Tools</a>. In this example, we will generate <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCXML" target="_blank">Statechart
        XML (SCXML)</a> from a simple stopwatch state machine. The stopwatch use
      case is taken from the <a
        href="http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-scxml/usecases/scxml-stopwatch.html">Apache
        Commons SCXML</a> site. The stopwatch model consists of four different
      states (<b>ready, running, stopped,</b> and <b>paused</b>) and the state
      transitions are triggered by events that represent the stopwatch buttons (<em>watch.start,
        watch.stop, watch.split, watch.unsplit, watch.reset</em>).

    </p>
    <p>
      Note that this example is not a full-fletched Statechart XML code
      generator, only the basic concepts of <em>states, transitions</em> and <em>events</em>
      are supported to showcase how to get started. We expect the following XML
      fragment to be generated from the model above:
    </p>
    <pre id="xmlOutput" class="xml prettyprint">
      <code>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;scxml xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/07/scxml" version="1.0" initial="ready"&gt;
   &lt;state id="ready"&gt;
      &lt;transition event="watch.start" target="running" /&gt;
   &lt;/state&gt;
   &lt;state id="running"&gt;
      &lt;transition event="watch.split" target="paused" /&gt;
      &lt;transition event="watch.stop" target="stopped" /&gt;
   &lt;/state&gt;
   &lt;state id="paused"&gt;
      &lt;transition event="watch.stop" target="stopped" /&gt;
      &lt;transition event="watch.unsplit" target="running" /&gt;
   &lt;/state&gt;
   &lt;state id="stopped"&gt;
      &lt;transition event="watch.reset" target="ready" /&gt;
   &lt;/state&gt;
&lt;/scxml&gt;</code>
    </pre>
    <h2>SExec and SGraph meta models</h2>
    <p>
      Before starting with a code generator, we have to decide which of the two
      available meta models is most suitable for the use case. In model driven
      software development, a model always conforms to another model commonly
      referred to as a meta model. This meta model defines the building blocks a
      model can consist of. When developing a generator for YAKINDU SCT you can
      choose between two different meta models, <em>Sgraph</em> and <em>SExec</em>.
      In broad terms, <em>SGraph</em> represents the structure of the modeled
      statemachine (<em>States, Transitions, Events</em>) while <em>SExec </em>contains
      sequences that encapsulates our execution semantics (for example <em>Checks,
        Calls and Stateswitch</em>).
    </p>
    <p>
      The SGraph meta model is similar to the state machine meta model known
      from the UML. We have a top level element <em>Statechart</em> that
      contains a set of <em>States</em> and <em>Transitions</em>. <em>Transitions
      </em>may have events and a source and a target <em>State</em>. The following
      shows a very simplified version of SGraph.
    </p>
    <p>

        alt="sgraph.png" width="373" height="241">
    </p>
    <p>
      In contrast, the SExec meta model defines an <em>ExecutionFlow </em>that
      contains a set of <em>ExecutionStates</em>. Every ExecutionState has an
      entry and an exit sequence of different <em>Steps</em>. Each Step can be
      of a different type, for example a <em>StateSwitch</em> or a <em>Check</em>.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to generate code for a runtime environment that somehow
      interprets a statechart structure (for example SCXML or <a
        href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-statemachine/">Spring
        Statemachine</a>) you should pick SGraph meta model. If you want to generate
      a code-only approach for another programming language and you want to
      ensure that it behaves exactly in the way all the other code generators
      behave you should pick the SExec meta model.
    </p>
    <h2>The sample Statechart XML generator</h2>
    <p>
      Creating custom code generators is really easy, it is a first-level
      concept in YAKINDU Statechart Tools. You can develop them directly within
      your project workspace. This is pretty awesome - adoptions to the model or
      the generator templates are executed instantly and you don't have to
      bother with long code-compile-test cycles. More information about how to
      setup a new code generator project is out of the scope of this blog post
      and can be found <a
        href="https://www.itemis.com/en/yakindu/statechart-tools/documentation/user-guide/#custom-code-generators">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When choosing the language for developing a new generator, you should
      consider using <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/xtend/">Xtend</a> instead
      of Java. The syntax is familiar for every Java developer, but it adds some
      nice features like <a
        href="https://eclipse.org/xtend/documentation/203_xtend_expressions.html#templates">template
        expressions</a> and <a
        href="http://www.eclipse.org/xtend/documentation/202_xtend_classes_members.html#polymorphic-dispatch">dispatch
        methods</a> that are really useful for developing code generators.
    </p>
    <p>The example Statechart XML generator implemented with Xtend could
      look like this:</p>
    <script
      src="https://gist.github.com/andreasmuelder/ca415996d7ef3af1a3c9ad3e9423defd.js"></script>
    <p>
      The <em>SCXMLGenerator</em> class implements the <em>ISGraphGenerator</em>
      interface. This interface defines which meta model will be used for the
      code generator. If you want to implement a code generator based on the
      ExecutionFlow meta model you would implement <em>IExecutionFlowGenerator</em>
      interface instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The generate function uses Xtends template string to generate the scxml
      header. Most of the text ist static except the value for the initial
      attribute – this is calculated in the initialState function. After the
      scxml header, the <em>generate</em> function for the head region (parallel
      regions are not implemented) is called. This function simply iterates over
      all states in this region and calls the generate function for states .
      Other vertex types, for example <em>Histories</em>, <em>Synchronizations</em>
      or<em> Final States</em> are filtered out. Last, the generate function for
      states creates a new XML element and iterates over all outgoing
      transitions to generate the nested transition element.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can download the complete generator project form our new <a
        href="https://github.com/Yakindu/examples">examples repository</a>. If
      you want to run the generated SCXML you could for example use the apache
      commons-scxml interpreter.
