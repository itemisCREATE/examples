    <h1>Parent-first vs. Child-first Execution</h1>

    <p>This example demonstrates the two different execution schemes of composite states: child-first and parent-first execution. For more information, please also refer to chapter <a href="https://www.itemis.com/en/yakindu/state-machine/documentation/user-guide/sclang_parent-first_and_child-first_execution#sclang_parent-first_and_child-first_execution">Parent-first and child-first execution</a>.</p>

<h2>Composite state execution schemes</h2>
<p>
The parent-first and child-first execution schemes define in which order a composite state and its substates are processed:
<ul>
<li>
In the <em>parent-first execution scheme</em>, the composite state (parent) is processed first, before its substates are processed.
</li>
<li>
In the <em>child-first execution scheme</em>, the active substate (child) is processed first, before its parent composite state is processed.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
We will use the following example model to explain the two different execution schemes:

The question that we want to answer is: What happens if event <code>e</code> is raised, i.e. which state gets activated, <strong>C</strong> or <strong>D</strong>; and what are the values of the statechart variables <code>m</code>, <code>n</code> and <code>o</code> afterwards?
</p>
<p>
Let's first answer which state gets active. When the event <code>e</code> is raised, the specified execution scheme defines which of the currently active states', <strong>A</strong>'s or <strong>B</strong>'s, outgoing transitions are evaluated first. In the child-first execution scheme, state <strong>B</strong>, the active child of the composite state, is processed first. Hence, the transition to state <strong>C</strong> is evaluated and taken. In contrast to that, in the parent-first execution scheme, the outer state <strong>A</strong> is processed first and state <strong>D</strong> gets activated:

</p>
<p>
Now let's take a look at the variable values. When starting the simulation (or when entering the statechart), the outer state <strong>A</strong> is activated first, independent of the used execution scheme. Afterwards, the entry action of state <strong>B</strong> sets <code>m</code> to 2. After event <code>e</code> is raised, the inner state <strong>B</strong> is exited first, before <strong>A</strong> is exited which sets the value of <code>o</code> to 1.
</p>
<p>
Notice the difference when child-first execution is used:
</p>
<p>
	<img alt="Example model after child-first execution" border="0" src="images/childfirst.png"/>
</p>
<p>
When event <code>e</code> is raised, state <strong>B</strong> is exited, setting variable <code>o</code> to 2. Furthermore, the outer state <strong>A</strong> stays active in this run-to-completion step and hence its local reaction is executed, setting <code>n</code> to 1.
