    <h1>Event-driven vs. Cycle-based Execution</h1>

    <p>This example demonstrates the two different execution schemes of CREATE statecharts: event-driven and cycle-based execution. For more details, please refer to chapter <a href="https://www.itemis.com/en/yakindu/state-machine/documentation/user-guide/codegen_general_concepts_of_the_state_machine_code#codegen_execution_schemes">Execution schemes</a> in our documentation.</p>

<h2 id="codegen_execution_schemes">Execution schemes</h2>
<p>The state machine can define one of two different execution schemes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>In the 
		<em>cycle-based execution scheme</em>, a run-to-completion step is executed <strong>periodically</strong> in regular time intervals.
	</li>
	<li>In the 
		<em>event-driven execution scheme</em>, a run-to-completion step is executed <strong>each time an event is raised</strong>.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can select the execution scheme in the definition section by either using the <code>@CycleBased</code> or <code>@EventDriven</code> annotation. If nothing is specified, the cycle-based execution scheme with a time interval of 200 milliseconds is used for simulation. 
</p>
<p>
In the following, the difference between the two execution schemes will be explained on a simple example model.
</p>
</p>
<h2>Cycle-based execution scheme</h2>
<p>
In the cycle-based execution scheme, a run-to-completion step is processed in regular time intervals. For example, the annotation <code>@CycleBased(2000)</code> means that a cycle is invoked every 2000 milliseconds. In the example below, this means that it might take up to two seconds after the <code>input</code> event has been raised for the statechart to process it and activate <strong>StateB</strong>. Same holds for time events. To illustrate this, <strong>StateC</strong> has two outgoing transitions with different time triggers. With a cycle period of 2 seconds, both time triggers are valid. The state machine will then take the higher prioritized transition, which in this case is the one to <strong>StateE</strong>. Changing the cycle period from 2000 to 200 milliseconds will cause <strong>StateD</strong> to be activated as the run-to-completion cycle is executed before the 500ms trigger is raised.

 </p>
<p>
Please note that it is the responsibility of the client code to implement the cycle loop. The generated state machine code provides a <code>runCycle()</code> method that needs to be called periodically.
</p>
<h2>Event-driven execution scheme</h2>
<p>
In the event-driven execution scheme, incoming events and time events are processed immediately. Consequently, when raising the <code>input</code> event, the statechart instantly activates <strong>StateB</strong>. <strong>StateC</strong> is activated after 200 milliseconds and similarly, the state machine always finishes in <strong>StateD</strong>.

 </p>
<p>
Please note that in contrast to the cycle based execution scheme, the client code does not need to invoke the <code>runCycle()</code> method. This is handled internally when a <code>raiseEvent()</code> method is called.
</p>
<p>
Both execution schemes also imply a different semantic when orthogonal regions are used. Please check out our example on orthogonal states for more information.
