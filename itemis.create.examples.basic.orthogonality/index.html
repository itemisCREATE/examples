    <h1>Orthogonality</h1>

    <p>This example demonstrates the usage of orthogonal states as well as of forking and joining synchronization nodes. For more details, please also refer to our <a href="https://www.itemis.com/en/yakindu/state-machine/documentation/user-guide/sclang_graphical_elements#sclang_synchronizations">documentation</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>Orthogonal regions</h2>
<p>
Itemis CREATE allows to specify orthogonal regions that are executed virtually concurrently. Orthogonal regions can be modeled either on top level, or within a composite state (or subdiagram). They allow to describe that the modeled system can be in multiple states simultaneously.

<p>
Let's take the simplified example of a keyboard controller. The user can enable caps lock and num lock. These are two independent functionalities, and the keyboard can have both enabled at the same time.

<h2>Forks and joins</h2>

<p>
Orthogonal regions can not only be defined on top level but also within composite states. The semantics explained above are the same. 
The following example model uses a synchronization node to fork the execution flow into both orthogonal regions. After both regions have executed their state transitions, the execution flow is joined again by a synchronization node. A joining synchronization is only executed when all incoming transitions can be taken within the same run-to-completion cycle.
