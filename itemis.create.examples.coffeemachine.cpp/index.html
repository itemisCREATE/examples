    <h1>[Pro] Coffee Machine with C++ integration</h1>
    <p>
      This is a example for the deep C++ integration of CREATE
      statecharts. It shows how C++ classes can be used as variables and is based on the C example: <p><img
        alt="Model"
        src="images/CoffeeMachineCpp_0.png" /></p> The statechart consists of two
      major states "ON" and "OFF". The "ON" state is a composite state with
      several substates and substate machines for the different modes.

    <h2>Using deep C++ integration</h2>
    <p>Imported classes can be referenced by declaring a variable and using the 
    class as the type of it.
    Within the example two classes are referenced:
    <ul>
      <li>var cm : Coffee_Machine</li>
      <li>var hmi : CM_HMI</li>
    </ul>
    They can be used to access members of the class, like functions, variables, typedefs, etc.
    For example the class Coffe_Machine, which is declared as the variable cm, includes a function called stop heating:
  	<img class="tiny"
        alt="Functions"
        src="images/functions.png" /> </p>
    <h2>Simulation</h2>
    <p> The declared variables can be used and changed in the simulation view.<img
    	class="tiny"
        alt="SimulationView"
        src="images/simulationview.png" /> </p>
    <h2>Generate state machine code</h2>
    <p>If you have changed the model you can generate state machine code by
      right-click on 'CoffeeMachine.sgen' and choose 'Generate Code Artefacts'.
      This will generate:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>CoffeeMachineCpp.hpp</li>
      <li>CoffeeMachineCpp.cpp</li>
    </ul>
