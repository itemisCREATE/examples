    <h1>Digital Watch</h1>

    <p>This digital watch was first designed by Harel, the founder of the
      Statecharts Theory. He described it in "On Visual Formalisms", published
      in "Communications of the ACM" in May 1988.</p>

    <div>
      <h2>The Digital Watch in all its Details</h2>

      <p>As you can see in the picture below, the complete statechart is
        rather complicated and not easy to grasp on first glance:</p>

      <p>
        <img class="standard-image"
          alt="The digital watch statechart in all its details"
          src="images/watch.png" />
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Gaining a Better Understanding Using Subdiagrams</h2>
      <p>We can use a CREATE SCT feature to extract composite states into
        subdiagrams. This makes the statechart much easier to comprehend:</p>
      <p>
        <img class="standard-image"
          alt="The digital watch statechart with details hidden into subdiagrams"
          src="images/watch_subdiagrams.png" />
      </p>

      <p>Using subdiagrams allows you to abstract the statechart to any
        level you want, so that you can review the statechart's overall
        functionality and its inner workings separately â€“ much like a class
        diagram versus the complete codebase. Copy the example to your workspace
        and try out the subdiagram editor!</p>

      <h2>The Interface Definition</h2>
      <p>For reference, here's the interface declaration of both
        statecharts:</p>

      <p>
        <img class="tiny" alt="Interface declaration"
          src="images/watch_declaration.png" />
      </p>
