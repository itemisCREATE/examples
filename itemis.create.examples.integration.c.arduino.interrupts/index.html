    <h1>Arduino - Integration Guide using Interrupts (C)</h1>

    <p>
   Embedded Systems Integration Guide - Arduino with @CycleBased or @EventDriven execution using Interrupts.
    </p>
    <p>
    This example has been created to illustrate how an Arduino can be programmed using @CycleBased or @EventDriven execution and interrupts.
    You can find a detailed description in our <a href="https://www.itemis.com/en/yakindu/state-machine/documentation/user-guide/embedded_systems_integration_guide">documentation</a>.
	</p>
		<h2>The state machine</h2>
	<p>
	The state machine contains the following parts:
	<ul>
	<li>Two regular states</li>
	<li>One final state</li>
	<li>Two incoming events</li>
	<li>Two outgoing events</li>
	<li>One timed event</li>
	</ul>
	The main idea is to use every component, 
	which has an effect on the integration of the state machine code.
	A detailed description can be found in our <a href="https://www.itemis.com/en/yakindu/state-machine/documentation/user-guide/embedded_systems_integration_guide">documentation</a>.

    <h2>Addons for compiling and flashing</h2>
    <p>All Arduino examples can be compiled via command line or be imported into the Arduino IDE. An easier way is using the <a href="https://eclipse.baeyens.it/">Sloeber plugin</a> , which allows you to compile and upload the code directly in Statechart Tools.
    <h2>How to install the Sloeber plugin</h2>
    <p>
      There are two ways of how to install the plugin. The easiest way is using our example wizard, which allows you installing required plugins. Just follow the built-in instructions. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Another way is installing the plugin manually. You need to follow these steps:
     <ol>
      <li>Click on 'Help' -> 'Install New Software..' -> 'Add...'.</li>
      <li>Define a name and add 'http://eclipse.baeyens.it/update/V4/stable' as location.</li>
      <li>Choose the plugin - not the IDE.</li>
      <li>Follow the instructions</li>
      <li>The installation dialog will ask you for a restart. After this restart is done, the installition it will download some files. Just wait until it's finished</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Configure the Sloeber plugin</h2>
    <p>
    After the installation you should notice a new Toolbar, which allows you to compile and flash your Arduino.
    Initially, the projects are not configured, as you may require to add the toolchain:
    <ol>
      <li>Click on Window -> Preferences</li>
      <li>Open the Arduino window -> Platforms and Boards</li>
      <li>Depending on your Arduino, choose the board. For the UNO click on arduino -> Arduino AVR -> check out one toolchain</li>
      <li>Click on Apply and Close and wait until the downlaod has been finished</li>
    </ol>
    Some examples may need different libraries. E.g. the LiquidCrystal lib. If so, repeat the steps using the Library Manager and add your required lib.
  </p>
  <h2>Configure the example</h2>
  Once you have installed the toolchain for your Arduino, you can configure the project.
  <ol>
    <li>Right click the project and open the Preference page</li>
    <li>Open the Arduino window</li>
    <li>Choose your platform and port</li>
  </ol>
  There will be a dialog, which warns you that the platform.txt is missing. This is not a problem and will be resolved after the intitial configuration.
  <h2>Compile and upload</h2>
  <p>
  Finally, you can use the green toolbar for compiling and flashing the Arduino. Have fun!
