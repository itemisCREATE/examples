    <h1>Basic Finite State Machine for Arduino</h1>

    <p>A very basic example for the Arduino platform that switches an LED on
      and off.</p>

    <p>
      This example was used in an article on the website <a
        href="http://www.instructables.com/">instructables.com</a>. You can read
      the article <a
        href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Finite-State-Machine-on-an-Arduino/">here</a>.
      It demonstrates how to get started with Itemis CREATE and the
      Arduino platform and contains a timer service for the Arduino. You need to
      have an Arduino plugin, as described in the example "Arduino traffic
      light" and in the linked article.
    </p>

        <h2>Addons for compiling and flashing</h2>
    <p>All Arduino examples can be compiled via command line or be imported into the Arduino IDE. An easier way is using the <a href="https://eclipse.baeyens.it/">Sloeber plugin</a> , which allows you to compile and upload the code directly in Statechart Tools.
    <h2>How to install the Sloeber plugin</h2>
    <p>
      There are two ways of how to install the plugin. The easiest way is using our example wizard, which allows you installing required plugins. Just follow the built-in instructions. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Another way is installing the plugin manually. You need to follow these steps:
     <ol>
      <li>Click on 'Help' -> 'Install New Software..' -> 'Add...'.</li>
      <li>Define a name and add 'http://eclipse.baeyens.it/update/V4/stable' as location.</li>
      <li>Choose the plugin - not the IDE.</li>
      <li>Follow the instructions</li>
      <li>The installation dialog will ask you for a restart. After this restart is done, the installition it will download some files. Just wait until it's finished</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Configure the Sloeber plugin</h2>
    <p>
    After the installation you should notice a new Toolbar, which allows you to compile and flash your Arduino.
    Initially, the projects are not configured, as you may require to add the toolchain:
    <ol>
      <li>Click on Window -> Preferences</li>
      <li>Open the Arduino window -> Platforms and Boards</li>
      <li>Depending on your Arduino, choose the board. For the UNO click on arduino -> Arduino AVR -> check out one toolchain</li>
      <li>Click on Apply and Close and wait until the downlaod has been finished</li>
    </ol>
    Some examples may need different libraries. E.g. the LiquidCrystal lib. If so, repeat the steps using the Library Manager and add your required lib.
  </p>
  <h2>Configure the example</h2>
  Once you have installed the toolchain for your Arduino, you can configure the project.
  <ol>
    <li>Right click the project and open the Preference page</li>
    <li>Open the Arduino window</li>
    <li>Choose your platform and port</li>
  </ol>
  There will be a dialog, which warns you that the platform.txt is missing. This is not a problem and will be resolved after the intitial configuration.
  <h2>Compile and upload</h2>
  <p>
  Finally, you can use the green toolbar for compiling and flashing the Arduino. Have fun!
