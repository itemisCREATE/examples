    <h1>[Pro] Blinky LED for MSP430</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      <img class="tiny" src="images/msp430.jpg" />
    </p>
    <p>This tutorial contains three parts:</p>
    <p>1. Installing the CREATE Statechart Tool as a Plugin into Texas
      Instruments Code Composer Studio</p>
    <p>2. Adding state machines to the project</p>
    <p>3. Creating the Blinky example with the Professional Edition</p>
    <p>The whole tutorial gives you step-by-step instructions to enable you
      to upload the project.</p>

    <h2>Installing the CREATE Statechart Tool as a Plugin into Texas
      Instruments Code Composer Studio</h2>
    <p>First, you need to install TIs Code Composer Studio, which you can
      find here:</p>
    <p>
      <a href=http://www.ti.com/tool/CCSTUDIO> Click for download </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ensure you have at least chosen the MSP430 ultra-low power MCUs.
      <!-- What does this mean? -->
    </p>
    <p>
      Open your CCS after installation. You can choose a test example of TI to
      ensure that you are connected to the launchpad and that you can compile
      and upload Code. After this little test, you can install the plugin.
      Therefore, open the <i>Help</i> tab and click on <i>Install New
        Software...</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <img class="tiny" src="images/installNewSoftware.png" />
    </p>
    <p>There you can install Yakindu. You need two update sites for this.</p>
    <p>
      First you need to add the update site of Eclipse Neon to allow Yakindu
      Statechart Tools to find Xtext plugins. Click on Add and paste <a
        href="http://download.eclipse.org/releases/neon">to add Eclipse Neon</a>
      to your repository. You do not need to install anything, the update site
      just needs to be set.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img class="small" src="images/AddNeon.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, you need to get the download site of Itemis CREATE.
      Go to <a href=https://info.itemis.com/download-yakindu-statechart-tools>
        our download site </a> and complete the free registration, in case you have
      not done this already. Then you will get a number of different
      installation options. Choose the black button with <i>install from
        update site</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img class="small" src="images/DownloadOptions.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again, go over to <i>install new software</i>. There you add the URL
      you copied from our site. Choose at least the <i>CREATE Statechart
        Tools Professional Edition</i>. You will get a trial version, which lasts
      for 30 days. Don’t hesitate, our aren’t buying anything. If the time
      expired, you can still use all free Standard Edition features.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img class="standard-image" src="images/installSCT.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      Start the installation by clicking on <i>Next</i> and follow the
      instructions. The installation wizard asks if you really want to install
      the software. Click on <i>Ok</i>. After a successful installation CCS
      needs to be restarted. Afterwards, the installation is finished.
    </p>

    <h2>Working with CREATE Statecharts Tool in CCS</h2>
    <p>
      To use state machines proceed as normal and create a new CCS Project. Open
      the <i>File</i> tab, open <i>New</i>, click on <i>Other</i> and search for
      <i>Code Composer Studio</i>. There you can choose a <i>CCS Project</i>.
      Define a project name, choose your microcontroller and create a empty
      project, which contains an empty main.c file. I used the
      <code>MSP430G2553</code>
      .
    </p>
    <p>Now you can start working with state machines!</p>

    <h2>Working with CREATE Statecharts Tool Professional Edition</h2>
    <p>
      Right click the project, open New and choose a <i>C Statechart Model</i>.
      A Wizard will be opened in which you can select your project and name your
      statechart. For example, call it “<i>blinkyStateMachine.sct</i>”.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img class="tiny" src="images/addStatechart.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      The Statechart model will appear in the project folder after clicking on <i>Finish</i>.
      Click on <i>Yes</i> if you are asked to change the perspective.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you can import the header file to your state machine. Open the C
      Statechart Model and add “
      <code>import: msp430g2553.h</code>
      ”. This can also be done with code completion (<i>STRG + Space</i>). If
      the file was not found, try to refresh and clean your project. Your
      project should look like this, without any errors markers:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img class="large" src="images/emptySCT.png" />
    </p>

    <h2>Quite easy: a blink example created with the Professional Edition</h2>
    <p>The goal is to create a project in which the red LED gets initialized
      and toggles every 1 second. Additionally the WDT is used for the state
      machine's clock.</p>
    <p>
      To do so, rename the “<i>StateA</i>” to “<i>Initialization</i>” and add
      two new states named “<i>redOn</i>” and “<i>redOff</i>” to the main
      region. Add the “<i>always</i>” and the two “<i>after 1 s</i>”
      transitions, as shown in the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img class="large" src="images/stateSCT.png" />
    </p>
    <p>Then you can easily copy the code here, or you enter it on your own.
      Once again the code completion can be used. See how you can simply use all
      the defines from the imported header files? This really simplifies
      everything.</p>
    <p>
      <i>Initialization: entry / WDTCTL = WDT_MDLY_32; IE1 |= WDTIE; P1DIR
        |= BIT0</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>redOn: entry / P1OUT |= BIT0 </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>redOff: entry / P1OUT &amp;= ~BIT0 </i>
    </p>
    <p>Now the C Statechart Model is finished and should look like in this
      picture. After a rebuild a no error markers should appear.</p>
    <p>
      <img class="large" src="images/proSCT.png" />
    </p>

    <h2>Generate the C-Code</h2>
    <p>
      Now it is time to generate the C-Code. Therefore, a generator model
      (.sgen) must be added. Right click the project once again and open <i>New</i>
      and click on <i>Code Generator Model</i>. Choose a name for the sgen file.
      It is good practice to stay with the state machine name. Call it "<i>blinkyStateMachine.sgen</i>"
      for example and click on Next. Choose the desired state machine by
      clicking on the checkbox. Ensure that you have chosen the <i>CREATE
        SCT C Code Generator</i> and click on <i>Finish</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img class="small" src="images/sgen.png" />
    </p>
    <p>Build the project. The folders src and src-gen should appear in your
      project. They include the generated C-Code, which will be automatically be
      updated when you edit and save the statechart.</p>
    <p>Because this statechart uses time based events, a timer service needs
      to be implemented. To prepare this, you need these two files:</p>
    <p>
      <i>sc_timer_service.c </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>sc_timer_service.h </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      You can get them from <a
        href=https://github.com/Yakindu/examples/tree/master/basic_finite_state_machine_for_arduino/scutil>GitHub</a>,
      but they are already included in this example.
    </p>
    <p>Your project folder now should look like this:</p>
    <p>
      <img class="tiny" src="images/projectView.png" />
    </p>

    <h2>Change Compiler to C99</h2>
    <p>
      Now you need to set the compiler. Therefore, right click your Project and
      open the <i>Properties view</i>. Then go to <i>Build -> Advanced
        Options -> Language Options</i> and choose <i>Compile program in ANSI
        C99 mode. (--c99)</i> as the <i>C Dialect</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img class="standard-image" src="images/c99.png" />
    </p>

    <h2>Calling the State Machine from your code</h2>
    <p>Finally the state machine can be used in your main function. First
      you have to include the state machine and the timer service. Then the
      state machine, the timer service and the required functions for the timer
      service must be declared and defined. The main function contains two
      parts. The initialization and enter function of the state machine and the
      initialization of the timer. The second part is an endless loop - the
      while(1) loop. Within this loop the run cycle function of the state
      machine is called. Afterwards the MSP430 will be set into the Low Power
      Mode 0 and the General Interrupt Enable bit gets set. Now the
      microcontroller is sleeping and waits for an interrupt. After the
      interrupt of the WDT, the timer will proceed. This means that every timer
      gets updated and the elapsed time gets incremented by 32 - the time in
      milliseconds, which is proceed after every interrupt of the WDT.</p>
    <p>
      The <i>main.c</i> file is included in the example.
    </p>

    <h2>That’s it - Now you can build and upload the program to your
      MSP430!</h2>
    <p>Hopefully this tutorial helped you to successfully create a project
      for your MSP430. Now it's time to implement your own ideas!</p>

    <h2>System and Version Information</h2>
    <p>The following tools were used in the creation of this tutorial:</p>
    <p>System: Windows 10</p>
    <p>CREATE Statechart Tool Version: 2.9.3</p>
    <p>Code Composer Version: 7.0.0.00043</p>
    <p>
      <i>Note: The MSP430G2 Launchpad does not support Linux.</i>
    </p>
	
	<h2>Support for Code Composer Studio Version 6</h2>
	<p> Code Composer Studio V6 is based Eclipse Mars (4.5.) and Java 7.
	  Installing and running Itemis CREATE within CCSV6 requires two steps:</p>
	<p> 1st: Use the Mars update site instead of the Neon update site, which you <a
      href="http://download.eclipse.org/releases/mars/">can find here</a>. As I mentioned 
      before, you do not need to install anything of the Mars update site. Just add the update site. 
      After this you are able to install Itemis CREATE within CCS V6 as described before. 
      You need to get the download site of Itemis CREATE. 
      Go to <a href=https://info.itemis.com/download-yakindu-statechart-tools>
      our download site </a> and complete the free registration, in case you have
      not done this already. Then you will get a number of different
      installation options. Choose the black button with <i>install from
      update site</i>.</p>
    <p> 2nd: Itemis CREATE has been added, but it won't be executed, 
      because Java 8 is missing. Therefore, if you don't already have, install a 32 bit version of Java 8. 
      Afterwards, right click your CCS V6 shortcut and add the path of the 32 bit Java 8.
      For my machine it looks like this:</p>
    <p>
      	<i>C:\ti2\ccsv6\eclipse\ccstudio.exe <b>-vm "C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre1.8.0_141\bin"</b></i>
