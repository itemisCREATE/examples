		<h1>[Pro] TrafficLight with Multi State Machines</h1>
		<p>
			This example of a traffic light control demonstrates how to model multiple state machines
			that communicate with each other. It shows how you can embed a statechart as a sub machine
			into another statechart, control its life cycle, and communicate with the sub machine via
			in and out events.

			In this example, you will learn:
			<ul>
				<li>How to embed a statechart as a sub machine of another statechart</li>
				<li>How to control a sub machine's life cycle</li>
				<li>How to communicate with a sub machine by raising its in events and reacting on its out events</li>
				<li>How to change variables of a sub machine</li>
				<li>How to ask which of the sub machine's states is active</li>
				<li>How to test a multi state machine scenario</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			You can find more information on using the multi state machine feature in the <a
				href="https://www.itemis.com/en/yakindu/state-machine/documentation/user-guide/multi_state_machine_modelling">online
				documentation</a>.
		</p>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>
			The example is a traffic control of a street crossing using traffic lights. While a single traffic light is
			not so complex the coordination of different traffic lights on a crossing is a good example to highlight the
			collaboration between different state machines.
			<img class="large" alt="Street crossing with three state machines."

			The example consists of a system of three state machine instances. There are two instances of the statechart
			<i>TrafficLight</i> . Each instance just cares about controlling the different modes of a single traffic
			light.
			The <i>TwoWayTrafficControl</i> coordinates both traffic lights and makes sure that the traffic is always
			safe by
			making sure that no two traffic lights are green at the same time.

		</p>
		<p>
			This is the example that is used in our documentation on
			<a href="https://www.itemis.com/en/yakindu/state-machine/documentation/user-guide/multi_state_machine_modelling">multi
			state machine modeling</a>. We recommend to read that chapter in order to fully understand this example.
		</p>

		<!--
		<h2>Referencing state machines</h2>
		<p>
			In order to enable collaboration between separate state machines it must be possible that state machines can
			reference other state machines. To establish such a reference, the referenced statechart must be imported
			and a variable of the state machine type must be declared.
		</p>
		<p>
			For our example statechart <i>TwoWayTrafficControl</i> the declarations look like this:
		</p>
		<code>
			import: "TrafficLight.sct"<br>
			<br>
			interface: <br>
			&nbsp; var trafficLightA : TrafficLight<br>
			&nbsp; var trafficLightB : TrafficLight<br>
		</code>
