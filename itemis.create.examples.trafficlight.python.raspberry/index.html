    <h1>Traffic Light (Python) for Raspberry Pi</h1>

    <p>Demonstrates how to to generate Python source code from a statechart
    and use it on a Raspberry Pi (here: RP 3 Mod.B V1.2).
    </p>

    <p>In summary, there are two traffic lights: one for the traffic on the
      street, and one for pedestrians who want to cross the street. They can
      push a button to request their traffic light to turn green, which
      activates a blinking wait-light first. The street's traffic light then
      goes through the standard procedure, turning on the yellow light, followed
      by the red light, allowing the pedestrians to cross safely. After some
      time, the pedestrians' traffic light turns red again, and the cars are
      allowed to pass until the next request is made by a pedestrian.</p>

    <p>Additionally, the traffic light can be switched off completely. This
      turns the yellow lights into a blinking mode, signaling that the traffic
      light is indeed switched off and that the street should be crossed in a
      careful manner.</p>

    <p>The traffic light example is based on Python and contains an API for
      the Raspberry Pi that demonstrate the state machine behaviour in
      /model/TrafficLightCtrl.sct. This example combines generated Python code
      with manual Python implementations (using an API). To generate the state machine
      code, right-click on /model/TrafficLightCtrl.sgen and select 'Generate
      Code Artifacts'.</p>
      
    <p>To start the application you have two options. run
      src/traffic/light/TrafficlightDemo.java. For this, just right-click on the
      project and select 'Run As > Java Application'.</p>
      
    <p>The implementation of the API is based on the following circuit (created with
    <a href="http://fritzing.org">fritzing</a>):</p>

    <p>Please be aware of the following issues:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>The example requires Python 3.x .</li>
      <li>It's recommended to install the PyDev Plugin or something similar in your IDE first.</li>
      <li>You need the gpiozero library for _main.py_ . It is installed by default in
      Raspbian Jessie and Raspian x84. For further information see the documentation
      at <a href="https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">readthedocs.io</a>
      </li>
      <li>Before running the example, please check the hardware you are using - especially
      the model of your Raspberry Pi (here: Raspberry Pi 3 Model B V1.2).</li>
      <li>When you installed the example, Eclipse may show errors on the
        project. This is likely due to a missing configuration of the JDK. In
        this case select 'Properties' from the project's context menu and set
        the correct JDK in 'Java Build Path'. You will find further help in the
        'Java development user guide' section of the Eclipse help.</li>
