  <h1>Light Switch Example Series</h1>

  <p>This is a series of examples demonstrating multiple features of YAKINDU
    SCT. With each iteration, more features are shown. This example is a good
    starting point to dive into SCT headfirst.</p>

  <div>
    <h2>The First Iteration: A Simple Switch</h2>

    <p>
      This is the most basic way to model a light switch. When the <em>operate</em>
      event is raised, the light switch changes back and forth between the <strong>On</strong>
      and <strong>Off</strong> states.
    </p>

    <p>
      <img class="standard-image"
        alt="Basic light switch without any fancy features"
        src="images/01_light_switch.png" />
    </p>

    <p>
      The statechart can be simulated in YAKINDU Statechart Tools, but since the
      <em>operate</em> event is declared as <em>internal</em> it cannot be
      raised from any external client code.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>The Second Iteration: Introducing Interfaces</h2>

    <p>
      A statechart is accesible from the outside, i.&nbsp;e. from client code,
      via <em>interfaces</em>. This light switch version has an interface named
      <em>user</em>, and this interface provides the <em>user.operate</em> event
      to the outside so that it can be raised externally. Events declared as <em>internal</em>
      interface can – nomen est omen – only be used internally. YAKINDU SCT does
      not generate any methods to interact with internal objects except for the
      state machine itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      <img class="standard-image" alt="Second iteration, introducing interfaces"
        src="images/02_light_switch.png" />
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>The Third Iteration: Introducing Variables</h2>

    <p>
      While the classic theory of <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output_automaton">input/output
        automata</a> is only aware of events, <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_diagram#Harel_statechart">Harel
        statecharts</a> and YAKINDU SCT have many more features, including
      variables.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using variables, we can model a <strong>dimmer</strong>. The idea is to
      maintain the brightness of the lamp in a variable named <em>brightness</em>.
      Changing this variable's value corresponds to changing the lamp's
      brightness. Each time the state machine activates the <strong>Off</strong>
      state, the <em>brightness</em> variable is explicitly set to 0 in the <strong>Off</strong>
      state's entry actions.
    </p>

    <p>For this purpose, our assumed light switch no longer has only a
      single switch to turn the light on and off. Now it has two buttons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>The "on" button turns on the light and, upon repeated
          pushing, turn the brightness higher until the latter's maximum is
          reached.</p></li>
      <li><p>The "off" button turns off the light.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <img class="standard-image" alt="Third iteration, introducing variables"
        src="images/03_light_switch_dimmer.png" />
    </p>

    <p>
      When the user operates the "on" button for the first time, i.&nbsp;e. the
      <em>user.on_button</em> event is raised, the light is turned on at its
      lowest brightness level of 1. The state machine triggers the transition
      leading from the <strong>Off</strong> state to the <strong>On</strong>
      state. This transition has an action
      <code>user.brightness = 1</code>
      to set the brightness to 1.
    </p>

    <p>
      While the <strong>On</strong> state is active, each further push on the
      "on" button resp. each further raising of the <em>user.on_button</em>
      event, triggers the transition leading from the <strong>On</strong> state
      to itself. The brightness is incremented by 1 up to a value of 10. The
      guard condition
      <code>[user.brightness &lt; 10]</code>
      inhibits execution of the transition if the brightness is 10 (or greater,
      but that cannot happen).
    </p>

    <p>
      Operating the <strong>Off</strong> button switches off the light. The
      dimmer will not remember the last brightness level and will restart with a
      brightness of 1 when the "on" button is pushed again.
    </p>

    <p>The example shows how to manipulate a variable by an action as well
      how to use it in a guard condition in transitions.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>The Fourth Iteration: Introducing Composite States</h2>

    <p>
      Let's enhance our light switch by a <strong>motion sensor</strong>.
      Initially, the light is off, but whenever the motion sensor senses a
      motion, it turns the light on. After 30 seconds without any motion the
      light is turned off again.
    </p>

    <p>Operating the light switch manually overrides this behaviour at any
      time. When the user pushes the "on" button, the light's brightness is
      increased by 1, effectively turning the light on if it was off and turning
      it one step brighter if it was on already. In this mode the light switch
      behaves just like the dimmer described in the previous section. If the
      user pushes the "off" button the light switch changes back to motion
      sensing mode.</p>

    <p>
      The sensor is modeled by an additional <em>sensor</em> interface. It has a
      single event named <em>motion</em> event. The sensor raises this event
      when it detects a motion.
    </p>

    <p>
      For modeling the behavior of the light switch with a motion sensor, <em>composite
        states</em> come in handy, another important feature of YAKINDU SCT. A
      composite state is a state that contains one or more other states
      (substates). One of the advantages is the possibility to group states into
      logical compounds and thus make the statechart more comprehensible.
    </p>

    <p>Another advantage is the option to exit a composite state by
      transitions that have the composite state as their source states, not any
      substate. If such a transition is executed, the composite state is left
      regardless of which of its substates are active at the moment. You could
      achieve the same without composite states, but it would be cumbersome
      since you would need a transition from each of the plain states in the
      group to the "outside".</p>

    <p>
      In the model depicted below, the initial state defines the <strong>MotionSensing</strong>
      composite state as the first active state. This composite state has its
      own initial state, pointing to the <strong>Off</strong> state. A signal
      from the motion sensor, i.&nbsp;e. raising the <em>sensor.motion</em>
      event, transitions to the <strong>On</strong> state and sets the
      brightness to 1 via the <strong>On</strong> state's entry action.
      Subsequent <em>sensor.motion</em> events keep the state machine in the <strong>On</strong>
      state. After 30 seconds without any signal from the motion sensor the
      execution flow transitions to the <strong>Off</strong> state and the light
      is turned off again.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the user pushes the "on" button, the state machine transitions from
      the <strong>MotionSensing</strong> composite state to the <strong>Manual</strong>
      state, regardless of whether the active substate of <strong>MotionSensing</strong>
      was <strong>Off</strong> or <strong>On</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <strong>Manual</strong> state's entry action increases the brightness
      by one, so that the light is turned on when the source state was <strong>Off</strong>
      and turned one step brighter if the source state was <strong>On</strong>.
      The entry action is also executed each time the <em>user.on_button</em>
      event is raised, until the brightness reaches its maximum. The <em>user.off_button</em>
      returns to the <strong>MotionSensing</strong> mode and turns the light
      off.
    </p>

  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>The Fifth Iteration: History States</h2>

    <p>
      This example clarifies how history states work, what they do, and
      especially what they don't do. To illustrate this, we introduce another
      mode to our light switch: <strong>twilight / luminosity control</strong>.
      When operating in twilight mode, the light switch automatically turns on
      the light when it is dark and turns it off when it is bright. For this
      purpose we introduce a <em>luminosity sensor</em>. It permanently senses
      the ambient brightness and fires <em>lum_sensor.bright</em> or <em>lum_sensor.dark</em>
      events all the time. It is out of scope how "dark" and "bright" are
      defined and how they are configured in the luminosity sensor. Suffice to
      say that the sensor is always raising events – say, multiple times per
      second – and that each event is either <em>lum_sensor.bright</em> or <em>lum_sensor.dark</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The light switch is either operated manually or operates automatically.
      When in automatic mode, the light switch functions either as a twilight
      switch as explained above or as a montion sense switch, see the previous
      section. The user interface gets another button to toggle between the two
      modes via the <em>user.mode_button</em> event. We should have added a
      third automatic mode where the light switch doesn't do anything but simply
      turning the light of. However, for brevity we left that out resp. as an
      exercise to the reader.
    </p>

    <p>The light switch is starting to change into a full light control
      module. Its statechart now looks like this:</p>

    <p>
      <img class="standard-image"
        alt="Fifth iteration, including history states"
        src="images/05_light_switch_twilight.png" />
    </p>

    <p>
      The automatic modes are grouped into the <strong>Automatic</strong>
      composite state. That state is subdivided into a composite state for the
      twilight functionality and another one for motion sensing. We have
      discussed motion sensing before, but the <strong>Twilight</strong>
      composite state deserves some explanation. When the ambient brightness is
      changing from day to night or from night to day, the luminosity sensor
      doesn't deliver consistent values. Rather small fluctuations are causing a
      succession of quickly alternating <em>lum_sensor.dark</em> and <em>lum_sensor.bright</em>
      events. Having each of these events turn the light on or off,
      respectively, would result in a flickering lamp for some time during
      twilight. To avoid this, the state machine requires a certain permanence
      in the luminosity sensor's results before actually toggling the light's
      state.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is done like this: During the day the <strong>Twilight</strong>
      composite state's <strong>Off</strong> substate is active. In this state
      the state machine listens for <em>lum_sensor.dark</em> events. These
      events are starting to be raised when it is about to get dark. First they
      come in spuriously, later there are more <em>lum_sensor.dark</em> than <em>lum_sensor.bright</em>
      events within a given period of time, until only <em>lum_sensor.dark</em>
      events are raised. The first <em>lum_sensor.dark</em> changes the state
      from <strong>Off</strong> to <strong>Dark_waiting</strong>. In this state
      we are waiting until a certain time has passed, e.&nbsp;g. 10 seconds, to
      be configured as constant <em>lum_sensor.wait_time</em>. However, each <em>lum_sensor.bright</em>
      event brings the state machine back to the <strong>Off</strong>. Only if
      the waiting time has passed without any <em>lum_sensor.bright</em>
      interfering, the <strong>On</strong> state is reached and the light is
      turned on. The analogous happens in the morning when the first light of
      the day is close. The twilight switch is also robust against short
      disruptions like overshadowing the sensor during the day or illuminating
      it briefly by a car's headlamps during the night.
    </p>

    <p>
      An important requirement is that any of the automatic modes can be
      interrupted at any time by manually operating the light switch via <em>user.on_button</em>.
      When the user later raises a <em>user.off_button</em> event, the state
      machine should return to that particular substate somewhere down in the <strong>Automatic</strong>
      composite state that was active before the manual intervention. Similarly,
      when toggling between <strong>Twilight</strong> and <strong>MotionSensing</strong>,
      the state machine should remember the respective active substate and
      return there when control is turned back.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's what <strong>history states</strong> are good for. The statechart
      contains three <em>shallow history states</em>. There is one in <strong>Twilight</strong>,
      one in <strong>MotionSensing</strong>, and one in the <strong>Automatic</strong>
      composite state the former two are nested in.
    </p>

    <p>A shallow history state, contained in a composite state with a set of
      possible states inside that composite state, remembers which of these
      states was active when that composite state was left.</p>

    <p>
      The shallow history state in <strong>Automatic</strong> remembers whether
      <strong>Twilight</strong> or <strong>MotionSensing</strong> was active
      when <strong>Automatic</strong> was left, but it doesn't remember which
      state was active within the active one of these two. On re-entry, the
      history state would activate either <strong>Twilight</strong> or <strong>MotionSensing</strong>,
      but these would start on their respective entry states. This is why there
      is a history state in each of them as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have worked with history states before, you might be inclined now
      to say: "A <em>deep</em> history state would have been the correct thing
      here." However, you would only be partially right. A deep history state
      remembers the active state in its own region and everything that was
      active inside of this state, recursively down to the lowest level. We
      might spare the two shallow history states in <strong>Twilight</strong>
      and <strong>MotionSensing</strong>. But it would not behave in the same
      way – a history state is activated only when its containing region is
      actually left. Using one deep history state would not allow to remember
      the active state in <strong>MotionSensing</strong> when switching to <strong>Twilight</strong>,
      and vice versa. The deep history state would be activated only if we left
      the whole <strong>Automatic</strong> composite state – and when switching
      between automatic modes we are not going to do that.
    </p>

  <div>
    <h2>The Sixth And Last Iteration: Introducing Operations</h2>

    <p>This is the final version of the light switch, which has become a
      light computer. This version adds a presence simulation, which means it
      behaves as if a person operated the light at sensible and irregular
      intervals although nobody is present. The motion detection and the
      twilight detection are left out for clarity.</p>

    <p>The presence simulation is active on certain hours of the day only,
      namely from 17:00 to midnight and from 06:00 to 10:00.</p>

    <p>
      To implement this functionality, we are finally hitting the limits of the
      statechart language. It neither provides a function returning random
      values nor one to get the current date and time. However, YAKINDU SCT
      allows you to implement your own <em>operations</em> to overcome these
      limitations. An operation is called from the state machine itself, so you
      don't have to care about when and how they will be called. You can receive
      arguments from the state machine and return a value, exactly like a normal
      function or method call.
    </p>

    <p>
      <img class="standard-image" alt="Sixth iteration, introducing operations"
        src="images/06_light_switch_simulation.png" />
    </p>
	
	<p>
	We use this feature here to do two things:
	<ol>
		<li>
		Ask for the current time of day to decide if we should actually engage the Presence simulation (using the <em>every</em>-keyword 
		inside of the declaration)
		</li>
		<li>
		Ask for a random float to produce a random waiting interval in minutes between WAIT_MIN and WAIT_MAX. 
		Every 60 seconds, the waiting time is decreased by one. This happens in an orthogonal state to showcase
		the different available possibilities to do periodic tasks. Everytime wait_minutes reaches a value of 0,
		which means the waiting time is over, the <em>waitOver</em>-event is raised (<em>raise</em>-keyword)
		which makes the light switch between the <strong>On</strong> and <strong>Off</strong> states.
		On this occasion a new waiting time is calculated by calling <em>get_rand()</em> as well.
		</li>
	</ol>
	Furthermore, we make use of three <em>orthogonal states</em>, which you can see inside of the state <strong>Wait</strong>.
	The reason for this is that these three states are then executed virtually in parallel (their order is relevant, though).
	This way, we can have three tiny statecharts that count down every 60 seconds, check if a new waiting time needs to be
	calculated and if the light's state needs to be switched (the two latter ones happen at the same time, but the functionality
	is different).
	The other features of the light switch from earlier iterations are stripped away here to keep the statechart comprehensible.
