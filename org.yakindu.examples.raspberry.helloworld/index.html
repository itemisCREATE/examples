    <h1>Raspberry Pi Hello World</h1>

    <div>
      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>This example shows how to use a statechart and some C code to
        control a RGB LED attached to the Raspberry Pi.</p>

      <p>To compile it for the Pi, you need a cross compiler set up, or you
        need to compile it directly on the Pi.</p>

      <p>The project was designed on a Linux machine and uses the pthread
        library.</p>
