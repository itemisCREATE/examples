		<h1>Hierarchical Statecharts</h1>

		<p>This example demonstrates the usage of hierarchies in statecharts. It explains the concepts of <em>composite
				states</em> and <em>subdiagrams</em>.</p>

		<h2>Starting Point</h2>

		<p>Let's revisit the light switch example of the <a
				href="../examples/org-yakindu-sct-examples-basic-tutorial?exampleId=org.yakindu.sct.examples.lightswitch_series">Basic
				Tutorial</a>. To be more concrete, let's start at the point where our light switch can be in one of
			three possible modes:
		<ol>
			<li>a <strong>twilight / luminosity mode</strong> in which the light automatically turns on when it is dark,
			</li>
			<li>a <strong>motion sensing mode</strong> in which the light automatically turns on when motion is
				detected, and</li>
			<li>a <strong>manual mode</strong> in which the user can change the brightness manually.</li>
		</ol>
		The user can enable the manual mode by pressing the <strong>On</strong> button. Pressing the
		<strong>Off</strong> button enables the motion sensing mode. With a <strong>Mode</strong> button the user can
		switch between the motion sensing and the twilight mode.
		</p>
		<p>
			As each mode may be reflected in multiple states, switching between the different modes requires the
			modeling of many transitions. The following example shows one possible solution without using any means of
			hierarchies:
		</p>
		<p>
		<div id="noHierarchy"></div>
		</p>
		<p>Although the statechart consists of only five states, it is difficult to understand the underlying behavior
			because of the relatively high number of transitions. Consider the states
			<strong>TwilightDetectionMode</strong> and <strong>TwilightDetected</strong>. Both states have an outgoing
			transition to <strong>MotionDetectionMode</strong> with the same trigger. Same holds for all four automatic
			mode states, which have an identical transition to the <strong>ManualMode</strong> state.
		</p>
		<p>Having multiple states with an identical transition to the same target state is an indicator for the
			potential to group these states into one composite state.</p>

		<h2>Using Composite States</h2>

		<p>
			A composite state is a state that contains one or more other substates. It can be used to group states into
			logical compounds and thus make the statechart more comprehensible. Having one outgoing transition from a
			composite state is semantically the same as having outgoing transitions from each of the composite's
			substates. In that way, a composite stay can drastically reduce the number of transitions in the statechart
			and hence improve readability.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let's introduce composite states to our light switch example:
		</p>
		<p>
			<div id="compositeStates"></div>
		</p>
		<p>
			Compare the model with the one above. We introduced two composite states to logically group the states by
			the respective light switch modes. In that way we could reduce a number of transitions without changing the
			model's behavior.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are multiple ways to create a composite state:
		<ul>
			<li>Use the statechart element palette on the right to create a composite state.</li>
			<li>Select a normal state, press [Ctrl]+[Space] and choose <em>Add subregion</em>.</li>
			<li>Select a number of states (by holding [Ctrl]), right-click and choose <em>Refactor -> Group States Into
					Composite</em>.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			We can go one step further and create a further layer of hierarchy by grouping the two composite states into
			another composite state. In that way we can create multiple layers of hierarchy.
		</p>
		<p>
			<div id="nestedCompositeStates"></div>
		</p>
		<h2>Using Subdiagrams</h2>
		<p>
			Using composite states is a great way to make your statechart more comprehensible. However, as your
			statechart becomes bigger you might want to hide the details and only focus on the higher level
			relationships without loosing the semantic of your statechart. Subdiagrams come as a solution here.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the <em>Extract Subdiagram</em> refactoring is executed on a composite state, all containing regions
			are extracted into a separate diagram. The composite state no longer clutters the diagram with all its
			internal details, but instead appears almost like a normal state. The only difference is a small decorator
			icon in the lower-right corner of the state, indicating the existence of a subdiagram. When you hover over
			this decorator with the mouse cursor, you’ll see a small preview of the subdiagram’s content.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img alt="Light switch with subdiagrams" title="Light switch with subdiagrams" border="0"
				src="images/04_subdiagrams.png" />
		</p>
		<p>
			By introducing subdiagrams, we have hidden the details of the two light switch automatic light switch modes.
			In that way, you can directly understand which modes the light switch has and how to switch between them. If
			you are interested in the details, you can hover or click on the decorator to open the respective
			subdiagrams. You can revert these changes again by using the <em>Inline Subdiagram</em> refactoring.
