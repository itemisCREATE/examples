		<h1>Qt/C++ State Machine of a Traffic Light</h1>
		<p>
			YAKINDU provides a Qt specific C++ code generator for statecharts. 
			This example project shows how easy YAKINDU Qt/C++ state machines can be integrated 
			into Qt applications. 
		</p>

		<h2>The traffic light application</h2>
		<p>
			The example application is a simple traffic light with a red, yellow, and green bulb. 
			the traffic light automatically switches between these colors. Additionally there is a 
			maintenance control that switches the traffic lights from normal operation to attention mode
			and back. In attention mode the yellow light siply blinks.
		</p>

		<h2>Running the application</h2>
		<p>
			To get familiar with the example you may want to run the application. 
			This Yakindu/Eclipse project includes a preconfigured Qt-Creator project including 
			all required files. To run the included Qt application you require a Qt installation including its IDE. 
			If you have everything installed then open the Qt project file <i>./implementation/trafficlight-qt-cpp.pro</i> 
			in Qt-Creator. The configure the project, build, and run it. 
		</p>
		<p>
			To run this example an installation of Qt is needed. It is
			recommended to use the latest version, but at least <b>Qt 5.10.1</b>
			with <b>Qt Creator 4.6.1</b>. We also recommend to use MinGW 5.3.0
			and CMake for building the project when using Windows.
		</p>
		<p>
			To check the compiler configuration, navigate to <i>'Tools > Options ... > Build & Run > Compilers'</i> in your Qt installation.
		</p>

		<p>
			As soon as the application starts up you will see how the traffic light switches the colors starting with red. 
			if you want to switch the modes simply press the <i>pause/play</i> button at the bottom right corner.
		</p>

		<h2>The application logic</h2>
		<p>
			The behavior of the traffic light is defined by the single statechart (at <I>model/TrafficLightStateMachine.sct</I>). 
		</p>
		<img width="80%" height="80%" alt="The statechart" src="doc/trafficlights_sc.png" />
		<p>
			This statechart defines a set of in and out events that are used to interact wuth the application GUI. 
			The out events like <I>redOn</I> or <I>redOff</I> are used to switch the traffic light colors. 
			These out events will become Qt signals of the generated state machine class.
			The in events <I>standBy</I> or <I>operate</I> switch between the two main states <I>operating</I> and 
			<I>standby</I> of the traffic light. These in events will become Qt slots of the generated state machine class.
			The different colors are switched within the entry and exit actions of the different states by raising the 
			the different out events. The statechart defines to be event driven (see <i>@EventDriven</i> declaration). 
			This implies that the in events instantly trigger state transition if they are raised through a connected signal. 
		</p>

		<h2>Integrating with Qt</h2>
		<p>
			As mentioned above the Qt specific flavor of the C++ code generator makes use of Qt signals and slots.
			So the generated state machine can easily be integrated into Qt applications using this mechanism. 
			Beside the fact that the generated class inherits from <i>QObject</i> also a <i>QTimer</i> based 
			implementation of a timer service is generated if the statechart makes use of <i>after</i> 
			or <i>every</i> time triggers. 
			<i>implementation/main.cpp</i> includes the code that is required to set up the a state machine instance 
			and to connect it to the GUI. This user interface is implemented using a simple QML defintion 
			(<i>implementation/main.qml</i>). 			
		</p>

		<h2>Generating state machine code</h2>
		<p>
			Feel free to play around with the the traffic light and its statechart. 
			When you modify the statechart the code generator will automatically run and 
			regenerate the sources that you can find in the <i>implementation/machine</i> folder.
			Also the synchronization between YAKINDU and Qt-Creator works painless. 
			After generatimg the code Qt-Creator may ask you to synchronize the new versions of the 
			implementation files. Simply confirm and rebuild the project - thats it.
		</p>

		<h2>Installing the Qt/C++ code generator</h2>
		<p>
			If code generation does not work and YAKINDU shows error markers on the 
			<i>model/TrafficLightStateMachine.sgen</i> file then you likely have to install the 
			YAKINDU Qt/C++ code generator. 
			
			<ol>
				<li>Open <i>Help > Install New Software ...</i> from the menu.</li>
				<li>Select the Yakindu Labs entry from the <i>Work with:</i> pull down list. 
					If there is no such entry then
					<ol>
						<li>Choose <i>Add</i></li>
						<li>Enter <i>http://updates.yakindu.com/statecharts/labs</i> in the <i>Location</i> 
							field and optionally choose a name.</li>
						<li>Press <i>OK</i>.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Unfold the top level node and check the Qt/C++ code generator feature.</li>
				<li>Finish the installation wizard by choosing <i>Next ></i> until finished.</li>
				<li>Restart.</li>
