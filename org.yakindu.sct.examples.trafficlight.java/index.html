    <h1>Traffic Light (Java)</h1>

    <p>Demonstrates how to to generate Java source code from a statechart.
      The procedure is explained in the documentation, section "Java code
      generator".</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>In summary, there are two traffic lights: one for the traffic on the
      street, and one for pedestrians who want to cross the street. They can
      push a button to request their traffic light to turn green, which
      activates a blinking wait-light first. The street's traffic light then
      goes through the standard procedure, turning on the yellow light, followed
      by the red light, allowing the pedestrians to cross safely. After some
      time, the pedestrians' traffic light turns red again, and the cars are
      allowed to pass until the next request is made by a pedestrian.</p>

    <p>Additionally, the traffic light can be switched off completely. This
      turns the yellow lights into a blinking mode, signaling that the traffic
      light is indeed switched off and that the street should be crossed in a
      careful manner.</p>

    <p>The traffic light example is based on Java and contains a small GUI
      that demonstrate the state machine behaviour in
      /model/TrafficLightCtrl.sct. This example combines generated Java code
      with manual Java implementations (the GUI). To generate the state machine
      code, right-click on /model/TrafficLightCtrl.sgen and select 'Generate
      Code Artifacts'. To start the application run
      src/traffic/light/TrafficlightDemo.java. For this, just right-click on the
      project and select 'Run As > Java Application'.</p>

    <h2>Known issues</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>The example requires a JAVA 8 JDK.</li>
      <li>When you installed the example, Eclipse may show errors on the
        project. This is likely due to a missing configuration of the JDK. In
        this case select 'Properties' from the project's context menu and set
        the correct JDK in 'Java Build Path'. You will find further help in the
        'Java development user guide' section of the Eclipse help.</li>
