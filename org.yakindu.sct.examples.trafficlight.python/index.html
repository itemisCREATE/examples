    <h1>Traffic Light (Python)</h1>

    <p>Demonstrates how to to generate Python source code from a statechart.

    <p>In summary, there are two traffic lights: one for the traffic on the
      street, and one for pedestrians who want to cross the street. They can
      push a button to request their traffic light to turn green, which
      activates a blinking wait-light first. The street's traffic light then
      goes through the standard procedure, turning on the yellow light, followed
      by the red light, allowing the pedestrians to cross safely. After some
      time, the pedestrians' traffic light turns red again, and the cars are
      allowed to pass until the next request is made by a pedestrian.</p>

    <p>Additionally, the traffic light can be switched off completely. This
      turns the yellow lights into a blinking mode, signaling that the traffic
      light is indeed switched off and that the street should be crossed in a
      careful manner.</p>

    <p>The traffic light example is based on Python and contains a small GUI
      that demonstrate the state machine behaviour modelled in
      /model/TrafficLightCtrl.sct. This example combines generated Python code
      with manual Python implementations (the GUI). To generate the state machine
      code, right-click on /model/TrafficLightCtrl.sgen and select 'Generate
      Code Artifacts'. To start the application run
      src/Main.py. For this, double-click on 'Main.py', start it from the console
      or - if you already added the PyDev plugin to your IDE - just right-click on the
      project and select 'Run As > Python Run'.</p>

    </p>

	<p>Using the GUI:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Press the 'OnOff' Button to activate the traffic light system.</li>
	  <li>Press the 'Go' button to send a request.</li>
	  <li>At the end press 'Exit' to exit the program. This makes sure that
	  everything shuts down safely.</li>
	</ol>

    <p>Please be aware of the following issues:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>The example requires Python 3.x.</li>
      <li>It's recommended to install the PyDev plugin (or something similar) in 
      your IDE first (but not necessary).</li>
      <li>The example shows you a 'src' folder, because it follows the tradition
      of all the other examples. Please use the auto-generated 'bin' folder for
      your own projects if you like to write a little script showing the use of
      your generated state machine (this refers to Python packaging).</li>
    </ol>
