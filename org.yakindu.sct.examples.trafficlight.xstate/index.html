    <h2>How it works</h2>
    
    <p>In summary, there are two traffic lights: one for the traffic on the
      street, and one for pedestrians who want to cross the street. They can
      push a button to request their traffic light to turn green, which
      activates a blinking wait-light first. The street's traffic light then
      goes through the standard procedure, turning on the yellow light, followed
      by the red light, allowing the pedestrians to cross safely. After some
      time, the pedestrians' traffic light turns red again, and the cars are
      allowed to pass until the next request is made by a pedestrian.</p>

    <p>Additionally, the traffic light can be switched off completely. This
      turns the yellow lights into a blinking mode, signaling that the traffic
      light is indeed switched off and that the street should be crossed in a
      careful manner.</p>

	<h2>Run the program</h2>
    <p>The traffic light example is based on XState and contains a small GUI
      that demonstrates the state machine behaviour modelled in
      /model/TrafficLightCtrl.sct. This example combines generated XState code
      with a Typescript React implementation (the GUI). To generate the state machine
      code, right-click on /model/TrafficLightCtrl.sgen and select 'Generate
      Code Artifacts'. To start the application run
      npm install and npm start.</p>

    </p>


	<h2>Using the GUI:</h2>
	<ol>
	  <li>Press the 'ON/OFF' Button to activate the traffic light system.</li>
	  <li>Press the 'Request' button to send a request.</li>
	  <li>There is also an interactive representation of the statechart showing the current state.</li>
	</ol>

    <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Please make sure that npm and nodejs are installed correctly on your system.</li>
    </ol>
