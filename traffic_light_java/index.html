  <h1>Traffic Light (Java)</h1>

  <p>Demonstrates how to to generate Java source code from a statechart. The
    procedure is explained in the documentation, section "Java code generator".

  <p>In summary, there are two traffic lights: one for the traffic on the street, and
    one for pedestrians who want to cross the street. They can push a button to
    request their traffic light to turn green, which activates a blinking
    wait-light first. The street's traffic light then goes through the standard
    procedure, turning on the yellow light, followed by the red light, allowing
    the pedestrians to cross safely. After some time, the pedestrians' traffic
    light turns red again, and the cars are allowed to pass until the next
    request is made by a pedestrian.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the traffic light can be switched off completely. This
    turns the yellow lights into a blinking mode, signaling that the traffic
    light is indeed switched off and that the street should be crossed in a
    careful manner.</p>
